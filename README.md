# Kinesiophobia and Physical Activity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

## Rmd script
This repository contains an `Rmd` script "Kinesiophobia.Rmd" to conduct the meta-analysis examining the relationship between kinesiophobia and physical activity as well as subgroup meta-analyses and the meta-regressions. 

## Data for analyses in Rmd
The data used in the Rmd script are in "2024-05-02_meta_analysis_kinesiophobia_r.csv" for the main meta-analysis based on r estimates, and in "2024-05-02_meta_analysis_kinesiophobia_rho.csv" for the secondary meta-analysis based on rho estimates.

## Data from authors
Corresponding authors of articles that did not reported a correlation estimate of the association between kinesiophobia and physical activity were contacted. 
The Information_from_corresponding_authors.xls file reports the estimates or data the corresponding authors sent us and that were included in the meta-analysis.
